# project-for-data-science

 This project is looking at the correlation between movie genre popularity and GDP. To analyze
this, we found datasets relating to our hypothesis, and manipulated them to answer our question.
We had to clean the datasets to get data we can work with and visualize. We created graphs to see
relationships that relate to our hypothesis, and analyzed them.
I took charge of the data cleaning and date analysis part and conclude with the observation of the correlation between GDP per capita and movie genre preferences.
